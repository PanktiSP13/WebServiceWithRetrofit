# Retrofit Webservice with Kotlin Flow, MVVM, Hilt, and LiveData

This project demonstrates the implementation of making API calls using Retrofit in Kotlin. It showcases the utilization of Kotlin Flow, MVVM architecture pattern with Hilt dependency injection, and LiveData to create a responsive and efficient Android app. Additionally, the project encompasses multiple types of API requests, providing a comprehensive example of handling various network scenarios.

## Features

- API calls using Retrofit for efficient network operations.
- Utilization of Kotlin Flow for asynchronous and reactive programming.
- MVVM architecture for clear separation of concerns.
- Dependency injection using Hilt for improved code maintainability.
- LiveData for observing and reacting to data changes.
- Multiple request types showcasing versatile API call scenarios.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PanktiSP13/WebServiceWithRetrofit.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Usage

The project demonstrates a sample app that utilizes Retrofit, Kotlin Flow, MVVM architecture, and Hilt. You can explore the various API calls, response handling, and observe how data flows through the app's components.

Feel free to modify and extend the project according to your needs. You can integrate additional features, add more API endpoints, or experiment with different UI components.
